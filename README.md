# ðŸš€ DRF Blog Backend

Hello! Welcome to my **Django Rest Framework (DRF) Blog Backend** project. This is a robust and scalable API built with Python and Django, designed to power a modern blog application.

I developed this project as a comprehensive demonstration of my backend development skills, covering the full lifecycle from advanced API implementation to robust deployment strategies.

## âœ¨ Key Features & My Contributions

This project showcases my expertise in various aspects of modern web development:

* **Advanced API Development with DRF**: I've implemented a full-featured RESTful API using **Django Rest Framework**, leveraging **Class-Based Views**, **Generics**, and **ViewSets** to create efficient and maintainable endpoints for blog posts, comments, and user management. My work includes meticulous **Serializer** design for data validation and transformation.

* **Secure Authentication & User Management**: I've integrated secure authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** via `djangorestframework-simplejwt` and streamlined user management flows (registration, login, password reset) with `djoser`. **CORS headers** are properly configured for secure frontend-backend communication.

* **Comprehensive API Documentation**: To ensure ease of use for frontend developers, I've integrated **Swagger UI** and **Redoc** (`drf-yasg`) for interactive and auto-generated API documentation.

* **Efficient Background Processing & Caching**: I've implemented **Celery** with **Redis** as a message broker to handle asynchronous tasks (e.g., email sending), significantly improving API responsiveness. Additionally, **Redis** is utilized for high-performance caching, optimizing data retrieval.

* **Robust Testing & Code Quality**: My focus on code quality is reflected through the use of **Black** for consistent formatting and **Flake8** for linting. I've written extensive tests using **Pytest** and `pytest-django` to ensure code reliability. **Faker** was used for efficient test data generation.

* **CI/CD & Deployment Expertise**: I've managed the entire deployment pipeline, from containerization with **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to setting up **Gunicorn** and **Nginx** for production. My expertise extends to implementing **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** workflows using **GitHub Actions**, automatically testing and deploying the application to a **VPS**. I also performed **load testing with Locust** to ensure scalability.
